Title: Two-Group Straight Line ANCOVA
Description: Provides directly interpretable estimated coefficients
    for four models in connection with the two-group straight line
    ANCOVA problem: (A) the full model, which requires the fitting of
    two intercepts and two slopes; (B) a reduced model, which requires
    the fitting of a single intercept and single slope; (C) a reduced
    model, which requires the fitting of two separate intercepts and a
    single, common slope; and (D) a reduced model, which requires the
    fitting of a single, common intercept and two separate slopes.  The
    summary function provides tests of fit for the (null) hypotheses of:
    (1) equivalent data sets, (2) equivalent slopes, and
    (3) equivalent intercepts.
